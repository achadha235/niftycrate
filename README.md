Turn your NFTs into a profitable lootbox.

## For NFT Whales: Turn your NFTs into a profitable lootbox. 

**Problem:** You have lots of common NFTs that are hard to sell and only a few that are very valuable. You want to liquidate your tokens for as much ETH as possible.

**Solution:** Create an NFT lootbox to combine multiple tokens and use the randomised nature of loot boxes to encourage multiple purchases.

**Buying and setting up a NiftyCrate**

1. Buy a NiftyCrate from niftycrates.com
2. Put some NFTs into the NiftyCrate. To start, add 1 rare token and 3 common tokens
3. Set the NiftyRankingâ„¢ for each of the tokens. The lower the ranking, the greater the odds of a player drawing this token.
