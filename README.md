## For NFT Whales: Turn your NFTs into a profitable lootbox.

**Problem:** You have lots of common NFTs that are hard to sell and only a few that are very valuable. You want to liquidate your tokens for as much ETH as possible.

**Solution:** Create an NFT lootbox to combine multiple tokens and use the randomised nature of loot boxes to encourage multiple purchases.

**Buying and setting up a NiftyCrate**

1. Buy a NiftyCrate from niftycrates.com
2. Put some NFTs into the NiftyCrate
3. Set the NiftyRankingâ„¢ for each of the tokens to set the drawing odds
4. Configure the price to open the NiftyCrate
5. Sit back and profit

## For NFT Players: Open fun lootboxes, win great NFTs

**Opening a NiftyCrate**

1. Buy gems from Nifty Crate
2. Pick a NiftyCrate that looks like it has something you want
3. Pay the opening fee cost use a gem to draw an item from the NiftyCrate
